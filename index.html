                        With whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,
                        Or some lone bark buoy’d on the dense marine,
                        Where joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,

                        In full rapport at last.
                      
                        Here are our thoughts, voyagers’ thoughts,
                        Here not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said,
                        The sky o’erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,
                        We feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,
                        The tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the
                            briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,
                        The perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,
                        The boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,
                        And this is ocean’s poem.
                      
                        Then falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,
                        You not a reminiscence of the land alone,
                        You too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos’d I know not
                            whither, yet ever full of faith,
                        Consort to every ship that sails, sail you!
                        Bear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold it
                            here in every leaf;)
                        Speed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the
                            imperious waves,
                        Chant on, sail on, bear o’er the boundless blue from me to every sea,
                        This song for mariners and all their ships.
                        To thee old cause!
                        Thou peerless, passionate, good cause,
                        Thou stern, remorseless, sweet idea,
                        Deathless throughout the ages, races, lands,
                        After a strange sad war, great war for thee,
                        (I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be
                            really fought, for thee,)
                        These chants for thee, the eternal march of thee.
                      
                        (A war O soldiers not for itself alone,
                        Far, far more stood silently waiting behind, now to advance in this book.)
                      
                        Thou orb of many orbs!
                        Thou seething principle! thou well-kept, latent germ! thou centre!
                        Around the idea of thee the war revolving,
                        With all its angry and vehement play of causes,
                        (With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years,)
                        These recitatives for thee,—my book and the war are one,
                        Merged in its spirit I and mine, as the contest hinged on thee,
                        As a wheel on its axis turns, this book unwitting to itself,
                        Around the idea of thee.</td>
